# TweetMood
TweetMood app offers the user some preprogrammed tweets to post.

The app was reprogrammed in swift code.

## How does it work ?
Write your own personal tweet to post on your twitter account; or leave the field empty to send the preset messages and moods available from the picker.
<br><sub>(*If anything is written in the personnal message field, it'll be prioritized over the preset messages.*)</sub>
<br><br>Note that if you don't have any linked account to your tweeter, the app will alert you.

## Progress
